** ACID
   - Atomicity: Entire transaction takes place at once or does not happen at all, no midway, no partial.
                It follows, 'All or nothing rule'.

   - Consistency:  DB should be maintained so that the database is consistent before and after the transaction.
                   It refers to the correctness of a database.

   - Isolation: Multiple transactions can occur concurrently without leading to the inconsistency of database state.
                Transactions occur independently without interference.

   - Durability: This property ensures that once the transaction has completed execution, the updates and modifications
                 to the database are stored in and written to disk, and they persist even if a system failure occurs.
