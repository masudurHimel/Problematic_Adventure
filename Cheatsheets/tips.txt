*** DO Not use "+" for string concatenation [1]
    Note that strings are immutable. Hence, every time you add an element to a string with the "+" operator,
    Python has to create a new string with a new memory allocation. With longer strings, the memory inefficiency of the
    code will become more pronounced.

*** Using itertools for efficient looping [1]
    Itertools module enables memory-efficient looping by getting rid of unnecessary loops. Interestingly, the itertools
    module is called a gem as it enables composing elegant solutions for a myriad of problems.
