** It answers the question - "Whatâ€™s the database architecture in a microservices' application?"
** Use a (single) database that is shared by multiple services. Each service freely accesses data owned by other
    services using local ACID transactions.

Pros:
    - A single database is simpler to operate.

Cons:
    - Development time coupling. e.g. dependency of development.
    - Runtime coupling - because all services access the same database they can potentially interfere with one another.
    - Single database might not satisfy the data storage and access requirements of all services.
